	title = {The Yawuru Language of West Kimberley: a meaning-based description},
	abstract = {The present study is a descriptive monograph of the language spoken by Yawuru Aborigines of north-west Australia. The Yawuru language is genetically classified as a member of the Nyulnyulan family. Morphologically it is counted among the so-called "prefixing languages" and has a highly complicated inflexional morphology of verbs, whereas word ordering is remarkably flexible. In terms of syntactic typology, Yawuru is an ergative language which, however, reveals an accusative-type verb. agreement system. The practical orthography for the Yawuru language employed in this monograph is allophonic (i.e. slightly over-differentiating) rather than purely phonemic. Reasons for using such a spelling system are stated in Chapter 3. Throughout the description, considerable weight is laid on elucidating semantic aspects of the morphology and syntax of the language\_ rather than merely presenting forms and their combinations. A meaningwise approach is central to this description, particularly in the treatment of verbal and pronominal morphology (Chapters 4 and 7). Also semantically-oriented are accounts of preverbs. (Chapter 5), case marking (Chapter 6), adverbs (Chapter 8), reduplication (Chapter 9) and syntactic construction patterns (Chapter 10). A large number of sentential examples, more often context-bound than not, will be cited Â·in order to substantiate the points of discussion. Unless otherwise noted, all the sample sentences are taken from native speakers' natural spontaneous utterances. Comparative linguistics is outside the scope of this study, although several important facts are pointed out in footnotes.},

	url = {http://hdl.handle.net/1885/132899},
	abstract = {Chapter 1: In the first chapter I present a brief overview of the Nakkara language and its speakers. We look firstly at the linguistic type and point out that Nakkara belongs to the Non-Pama Nyungan family of Australian languages. Some of the salient features of the language are pointed out and comparisons drawn with other languages in the area. Alternative names used to refer to this language are listed, followed by descriptions of the traditional land estates of Nakkara speakers. The remainder of the chapter provides a backdrop for the language description by outlining relations with traditional neighbours, involvement with ceremony, arts and crafts, recent history and the language and its speakers today. Chapter 2: This chapter describes the phonology of Nakkara and includes phonemic analysis, stress patterns, phonotactics and word structure, phonological and morphological rules and orthographic representation. The most detailed area of analysis in this chapter is the interpretation of an audible stop contrast in the language. Stop length is introduced as a significant phonetic factor in the phonemic interpetation of Nakkara sounds. Chapter 3: This chapter is entitled Morphological Preliminaries. It gives a typological profile of the language and introduces most of the technical terms used in the morphological analysis of Nakkara. The parts of speech (or word classes) used in this description are also introduced here, as well as the morpho-syntactic notions of core, outer-core and peripheral levels. Chapter 4: The morphology of Nakkara is extensive and is therefore divided into three separate chapters. In this chapter we examine nominal morphology in general, looking firstly at independent pronoun morphology{\textasciicircum} then at pronominal affixes. Lastly the morphological functions of non-pronominal affixes and postpositions are introduced. Chapter 5: This and the following chapter deal with the morphology of verbal structures in the language. In chapter five the verb-complex ({VC}) is defined and the morphological components of the verbal pronominal prefix are analysed extensively. This introduces the notions of verb transitivity and valency, pronominal participant identification, the morphology of tense, status and polarity distinctions as well as Imperative and Hortative constrictions. A Chapter 6: This chapter deals with verb-stem morphology in Nakkara. We examine and categorise verb conjugations and look at the idiosyncrasies of monosyllabic verbs in this language. Other verb-stem components introduced are the orientation afffixes as well as the reflexive, reciprocal and inchoative affixes. Chapter 7: This chapter examines the form and function of the remaining word-classes and thus represents a bridge between description of the morphology and syntax of this language. These word-classes include qualifiers of space, place and time, interrogatives and indefinites, connective and introductory particles, mood particles and adjuncts (which function something like manner adverbials). Chapter 8: This final chapter looks beyond morphology to the structure of both simple and complex clauses in Nakkara. We examine firstly the occurrence of different types of verbless clauses in the language and then look at simple and complex verbal clauses.},

	abstract = {This is a study of Marrithiyel, a language of the Daly River region of the Northern Territory. Chapter One presents a brief introduction to the language and its speakers, and outlines my fieldwork methodology. Chapter Two then reviews the phonology, word classes, and the nominal case marking system. These matters are not treated exhaustively, but are rather presented as preliminaries to a study of the verb, the topic to which the major part of this thesis is devoted. Chapter Three is primarily concerned with the morphology of pronominal verbal affixes. This chapter introduces the basic verbal constituents: the auxiliary, the complex verb stem, the boundpronominal number markers, and the tense/âmood suffixes. The bound pronominals of the auxiliary are identified, and their various functions (including person, number, core role, tense/âmood, and transitivity marking) outlined. Three further sets of pronominals, able to appear at a subsequent position in the verb, encoding more peripheral roles, are also examined. Chapter Four deals with the tense/âaspect/âmood distinctions carried by the verb, outlining the seven major tense/âmood categories, and analysing the aspectual role of the intransitive auxiliaries. The incorporation into the verb of a number of temporal modifiers, tense/âmood suffixing of certain non-verbal constituents, and iterative verb-root reduplication are also considered. Chapter Five investigates the incorporation of noun roots into the verb, a process primarily involving a restricted set of body part terms. Two types of incorporation, "lexical" and "syntactic", are distinguished, and the domain and effect of each type of incorporation looked at in detail. The semantic range of body part terms, which may be incorporated in either literal or classificatory senses, is surveyed, and a number of verb stem derivations involving body part terms are presented. Chapter Six examines the semantic contribution made by the auxiliary to overall verbal meaning. Three groups of auxiliaries, the "major transitive", the "major intransitive", and the "minors", are identified and discussed. The major transitives are analysed as essentially instrumental in semantic character, while the major intransitives are seen as having more of a postural-aspectual function. Detailed exemplification is given throughout, and there is an illustrative text provided at the end of this study.},

@thesis{reid_ngangityemerri:_1990,

	title = {Ngan'gityemerri: A Language of the Daly River Region, Northern territory of Australia},
	abstract = {This thesis is a study of Ngan'gityemerri, a language spoken primarily in and around the two communities of Nauiyu Nambiyu and Peppimenarti in the Northern Territory. Chapter One provides an introduction to the names by which speakers of this language have been referred to, comments on the relationship between the two dialects, and establishes my use of the term Ngan'gityemerri as a language name. Also included in this chapter is a brief account of the history of these people since European invasion of their country began late last century, some comments on social organisation, cultural affiliations, Wangga and Lirrga songstyles, and a description of their country. The current status of the language is reviewed, and the language variety presented in this work is clearly identified. A survey of previous work on Ngan'gityemerri, and a description of my fieldwork methodology are additionally included. Chapter Two presents the segmental phonology, phonotactics, stress patterns and morphophonological processes. Particular attention, in the form of a detailed acoustic study, is given to the mechanism by which the contrast between two series of stops is maintained. Chapter Three presents an overview of 'simple' and 'complex' verb structures, then identifies the morphological make-up of the verbal elements labelled 'auxiliary' and 'complex verb stem'. The mechanisms that interact to mark categories of tense, aspect and mood, namely auxiliary root inflection, verbal enclitics, verb root reduplication and the serialisation of p o stu re /âm o tio n auxiliaries, are all addressed in this chapter. The incorporation into the verb of bodypart noun roots is also investigated here. A distinction between 'lexical' and 'syntactic' incorporation is invoked, and the differences in the effect of both these types of incorporation is dealt with. A list of incorporable terms is presented, and their literal and classificatory semantics explored. Chapter Four investigates the semantic contribution that the auxiliary makes to the meaning of a full verb. The 31 auxiliaries are broken down into six groups on the basis of their functional roles, which are described in detail. Chapter Five deals with the role played by both freeform and bound generics in classifying the Ngan 'g ity emerri nominal world. The morphology of these generics is surveyed with regard to the typological distinction drawn between 'noun class' systems on the one hand, and 'classifier' systems on the other. The semantics of noun class categories are also examined here. Chapter Six examines the set of enclitics, some of which have scope over {NPs} and others over clausal propositions. The semantic functions of this clitic set vary widely, some marking such case-like roles as 'agent' or 'instrument', others encoding the kinds of meanings, like speaker attitude, that are commonly attributed to free particles. The class of free particles is treated in Chapter Seven. Chapter Eight provides a brief presentation of space, time and number expression, and Chapter Nine deals with the freeform pronominal system, demonstratives and interrogatives. Appendices to this grammar include the full subject-auxiliary sequence paradigms for both Ngan'giwumirri and Ngan'gikurunggurr, as well as four texts. Cassette tapes of the textual material included in the appendices have been submitted with this thesis, and copies of these will gladly be made available by the author to any interested readers.},

	abstract = {This thesis is about the life and language of kardu kigay â young Aboriginal men in the town of Wadeye, northern Australia. Kigay have attained some notoriety within Australia for their participation in âheavy metal gangsâ, which periodically cause havoc in the town. But within Australianist linguistics circles, they are additionally known for speaking Murrinh Patha, a polysynthetic language that has a number of unique grammatical structures, and which is one of the few Aboriginal languages still being learnt by children. My core interest is to understand how peopleâs lives shape their language, and how their language shapes their lives. In this thesis these interests are focused around the following research goals: (1) To document the social structures of kigayâs day-Â­âto-Â­âday lives, including the subcultural âmetal gangâ dimension of their sociality; (2) To document the language that kigay speak, focusing in particular in aspects of their speech that differ from what has been documented in previous descriptions of Murrinh Patha; (3) To analyse which features of kigay speech might be socially salient linguistic markers, and which are more likely to reflect processes of grammatical change that run below the level of social or cognitive salience; (4) To analyse how kigay speech compares to other youth Aboriginal language varieties documented in northern Australia, and argue that together these can be described as a phenomenon of linguistic urbanisation. I will show that the âheavy metal gangsâ are an idiosyncratic local subculture that uses foreign heavy metal bands as group totems. Social connections and loyalties are formed on the basis of peer solidarity, as opposed to the traditional iv totemic system, which is structured around ancestry. Lives are now shaped by the dense (and often conflict-Â­âriven) town environment, as opposed to bush life, which was inseparable from the land. Kigayâs in-Â­âgroup language is a âslangâ variety of Murrinh Patha ({MP}), which deploys new words and phrases by borrowing and reinterpreting English vocabulary. It is also characterised by substantial lenitions and deletions in the pronunciation. The {MP} grammatical system still underlies this speech, but some of its more complex morphosyntactic forms are restricted to the âheavyâ speech of older people, and there are various mergers and reconfigurations occurring in the verb morphology. This thesis adds to the growing body of work describing how language contact and changing sociolinguistic dynamics are radically restructuring the linguistic repertoire of Aboriginal communities in northern and central Australia. At the same time, it is one of very few studies providing sociolinguistic description of a polysynthetic language, and is therefore an innovative study in polysynthetic sociolinguistics.},

	abstract = {This thesis provides the first detailed description of Emmi, a dying language spoken by about two dozen adults who are based at Belyuen on the Cox Peninsula west of Darwin. Chapter One first explains the geographical, historical and social context of the language and its speakers. It describes my fieldwork methodology, and provides an overview of the Emmi language and its typological singularities. It provides a critique of earlier work on the language and summarises what is known about the relationship of Emmi to neighbouring languages. Chapter Two describes the segmental phonology of the language. It provides evidence for the existence of a voicing contrast between stops and the existence of two phonemic fricatives. It shows how the stress patterns of complex morphemes which have been subsumed into the verb reveal that they were once independent words. Chapter Three describes the nominal morphology of the language, with particular reference to the role of adnominal enclitics as {NP} relators. It explains the function of the generic nouns awa 'meat' and miya 'edible plant, the five ways used to express the possessive relation, and the overlap between adjectives and nouns on the one hand, and adjectives and verbs on the other. Chapter Four explains verb structure, and analyses the morphology of the obligatory components: auxiliary verb, coverbs, bound pronominals, bound number words. Chapter Five examines the possible combinations of auxiliary and coverb and works out the semantic and syntactic motivations for cooccurrence. Chapter Six describes nominal incorporation, distinguishing between lexical and syntactic incorporation and showing how lexically incorporated bodyparts function as metaphors and classifiers for entities v1ith the same shape as the bodypart. Chapter Seven describes the functions of the fourteen propositional enclitics. Chapter Eight describes the syntax of simple and complex clauses with particular focus on serial ronstructions. It shows how the major intransitive auxiliary verbs have been polygrammaticised to provide aspectual information. Appendix A comprises Basedow's word-lists of the language, dating from 1906. Appendix B gives Capell's raw Ami data, dating from the 1950s. Appendix C sets out the auxiliary verb paradigms. Appendix D consists of six texts.},

	abstract = {Yuwaalaraay and Gamilaraay are closely related languages from the North of New South Wales which had dramatically declined in use and are now being reused by many Yuwaalaraay Gamilaraay people in a variety of ways. This thesis expands the grammatical description of the languages, building in particular on Williams (1980). A wide range of sources from the mid-19th century to the tapes made in the 1970s are examined. Light is shed on them by the growing body of typology of Pama-Nyungan languages and in particular by Donaldsonâs (1980) Grammar of Wangaaybuwan, which along with Gamilaraay, Yuwaalaraay, Wayilwan and Wiradjuri form the Central New South Wales language sub-group. The main topics covered are nominal morphology (Chapters 2-6), verbal morphology (Chapters 7-9) and syntax (Chapters 10-11). Chapter 8 covers interrogatives, negatives, indefinites and ignoratives. Notable features of nominals include the complex, and not yet fully described, set of demonstratives. {YG} verbs have a wide range of stem forming suffixes, including distinctive Time of Day suffixes (morning, afternoon and night), and Distance in Time suffixes which subdivide the past and future. Included is the first description of the middle verb forms, which have a range of case frames. Where possible the grammar of the languages is described, with extensive evidence from the sources. Often there is currently unanalysable material, and this is often included, providing a starting point for further work on the languages. The thesis has an appendix, which contains background {YG} material and material from other languages. There is also a resource disc which has transcriptions of many of the source documents and tapes.},

	abstract = {The recent years have witnessed an increase in revisiting language descriptions of the 'sleeping' traditional languages of south-east Australia from available historic material. The languages of south-east New South Wales have thus far been largely neglected and this thesis fills a gap in the contemporary language work that has and still is being undertaken on traditional New South Wales languages. This research study investigates the traditional Aboriginal languages of the New South Wales South Coast. The languages presented here are Dharrawal, Dharumba, Dhurga and Djirringanj, which were spoken from the southern parts of Sydney and Botany Bay down along the coast, close to the Victorian border. The language material used for the analysis consists entirely of archival material that was collected by various people between ca. 1834 and 1902. Although previous work on the New South Wales South Coast languages (see Capell (n.d.) and Eades' (1976)) offered insight into the structure of the languages, the available archival material has not been exhaustively utilised until now. Part B of this thesis presents the seventeen previously unanalysed texts transcribed by Andrew Mackenzie and Robert Hamilton Mathews during the latter half of the 19th Century. These texts supply a significant amount of additional morphological and syntactical information, and insights into narrative and discourse features; as well as mythologies of the South Coast people. Throughout the thesis, issues of working from archival material are appropriately discussed to clarify interpretation of the material and to introduce the reader to the stages and processes involved in working from historic material. This work is ultimately produced as a tool for local Aboriginal communities and community members to assist in current and future language reclamation and revitalisation projects, and to allow for projects to aim for higher language proficiency than has previously been possible.},

	abstract = {This thesis is a comprehensive description of Wanyjirra, a moribund Ngumpin-Yapa language originally spoken in the south-west Victoria River District of the Northern Territory, Australia. Based on elicited data and narratives recorded between 2009 and 2012 and legacy materials, this grammar details the phonetics and phonology (chapter 2), word classes and general case functions (chapter 3), nominal morphology (chapter 4), free pronouns and interrogatives (chapter 5), demonstratives and directionals (chapter 6), pronominal clitics (chapter 7), noun phrases (chapter 8), verbal morphology (chapter 9), simple and complex predicates (chapter 10), other minor word classes and clitics (chapter 11), the syntax of simple sentences (chapter 12) and subordination and coordination (chapter13). It also provides a profile of the language and its speakers, including comparisons with neighbouring languages, a short description of special language styles and information about previous work on the language, methodology and characteristics of data (chapter 1). Wanyjirra is, in most aspects, typical of Pama-Nyungan languages and, as a language in the centre of the dialect chain, shows many similarities to other Ngumpin-Yapa languages. However, it possesses distinct features and merged features of its neighbours. The data also shows many dialectal or idiolectal variations in synchronic or diachronic context. The phoneme inventory contains five short vowels, one long vowel and seventeen consonants with a rich series of liquids but without fricatives. Syllables are mostly simple but can have complex codas only in coverb and adverb word classes. Lenition and nasal coda dissimilation are common morphophonemic processes especially in case and derivational allomorphy. Wanyjirra is a non-configurational language having grammatically flexible ordering of constituents and frequent ellipsis of argument {NPs}, which are cross-referenced by pronominal clitics. Constituent order is influenced by pragmatic salience and new and important information is often placed in initial position. Discontinuous {NPs} are not common and have specific discourse functions. The language is an agglutinative and suffixing language with a complex system of case marking. As is crosslinguistically unusual but relatively common among Australian languages, case suffixes do not only represent grammatical and semantic roles of {NPs} but also link two {NPs} and/âor link two clauses. The language shows a split marking between nouns/âadjectives and free pronouns: nouns/âadjectives take an absolutive-ergative declension whereas free pronouns make no morphological distinction between transitive subjects (A), intransitive subject (S) and transitive (direct) objects (O). Pronominal clitics, which show a nominative-accusative pattern, cross-reference core and non-core arguments constrained by animacy, sentiency and affectedness of referents. Wanyjirra discourse largely consists of strings of simple sentences with nominal or verbal predicates. It has only thirty-eight inflecting verbs functioning as simple predicates but some stems combine with coverbs, constituting a distinct word class, to form complex verbs. Although verbal clauses usually contain finite inflecting verbs, non-finite forms of inflecting verbs and coverbs can also occur as main predicates without finite verbs in discourse. Finite and non-finite subordinations essentially contain independent subordinators and finite verbs, and non-finite verbs or coverbs followed by subordinating suffixes respectively. Coordination is not morphologically indicated.},
