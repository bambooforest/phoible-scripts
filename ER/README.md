## Notes from ER

All good.  One issue which could potentially be a sticking point is that my representation of Australian inventories is fairly heavily typologized / standardized.  So, I don’t have detailed records of what individual authors have claimed for this or that segment, when it’s pretty clear that that degree of detail is just noise.  For example, some authors call their (non-contrastive) stops voiced, some voiceless, some partially (de)voiced; some just use symbols without further comment. Exceedingly little is based on detailed phonetic investigation.  So, all of these I just code using a voiceless symbol, representing the non-contrastiveness of voicing.  Similarly, languages with a contrast between stop (or obstruent) series get described as voiced/voiceless, short/long, fortis/lenis etc.  My representation uses fortis/lenis since that feature is inherently about contrasts rather than phonetics, and it captures well what is common across the languages, without overly committing to authors’ (mostly impressionistic) characterizations.  My concern is that, while that helps for meaningful typologizing of Australian languages among themselves, it may produce a different kind of data than what you’ve got in PHOIBLE for other parts of the world.  What do think, based on this quick description?

Cheers,
Erich

No probs. Attached here in UTF-8. The t, n, l with curl are laminal pre-palatals, i.e., [+distributed] [–anterior] coronals, at same place of articulation as e.g. [ɕ].
